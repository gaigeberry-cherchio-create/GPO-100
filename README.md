# GPO-100-Awsome tools
Champlain Game Programming class

This is a list of tools that could be of value to someone looking to develop games, this will include game engines like Source, frameworks, 3D modeling tools, and 2D art and texture tools.


Game Engines 

Source is an engine created by valve 

Pros 
1, Good modularity, the source engine is very modular allowing for lots of customization a good example of this is Respawns Titanfall branch of the source engine
2, Movement, source is generally considered to have good movement, and physics especially for first person shooters, although this is antidotal.
3, It’s free, for noncommercial use

Cons
1, It's a very hard engine to use, requiring a very intensive knowledge of c++, not recommended for beginners
2, It’s very old, giving it limited graphical and lighting capabilities
3, Not open source, you need a license to sell games

Gdevelop is an open source ending created by Florian Rival

Pros
1, Has cross platform export making it easy to set up the game on multiple platforms
2, Requires very little to no programming knowledge to set up game logic because of “Event-Based Systeme”
3, It’s free

Cons
1, Built for pc, mobile, and html5,
2, Has 3D support but it is very basic, the engine is better used for 2D platforms
3, Starts experiencing performance issues with large and/or complex games

Unit is a game engine developed by Unity

Pros
1, Unity has a very large asset store, lessening the burden of asset creation
2, Very popular, this means it gets continuous support and there are many online resources for developers to take advantage of
3, It’s considered to be very user friendly, and intuitive 

Cons
1, Unity can be memory hungry; this leads to performance issues and crashes on low end devices.
2, Many features are locked behind Unity pro
3, It has some graphical limitations, that is if we compare it to other popular game engines like Unreal.
